1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client required a web-based version of their Android game "Draw It or Lose It." Multi-platform support, unique identities for game objects, a user-friendly interface, rapid performance, scalability, and effective data management were crucial requirements.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt fairly comfortable with creating a comprehensive and structured design that addressed the client's requirements. This included a detailed domain model, system architecture considerations, and a outline of the project's goals and challenges.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document helped by providing a framework and roadmap for development. It facilitated the identification of key requirements and constraints, making it easier to plan and execute the coding phase effectively.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise a part of my work, I would focus on developing, refactoring, and enhancing the section related to user experience design. Improving this area could involve incorporating more user feedback and iterative design processes to better meet user expectations.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

My Interpretation the user’s needs by analyzing the client's requirements and then integrated them into the software design by ensuring the application was intuitive, scalable, and compatible across platforms. Considering the user's needs is crucial as it directly impacts the usability, satisfaction, and overall success of the software.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software applikcation?

My approach to designing software involved prolonged analysis of requirements, structured planning, and applying best practices in software architecture. In the future, I would use techniques like user-centered design, prototyping, and iterative development to analyze and design similar software applications. These strategies help in better understanding user needs and adapting the design to meet those needs effectively.
